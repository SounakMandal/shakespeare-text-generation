They grew to are at a prophed,
and sweet swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
that in the very refuse of thy deceived,
there gor is straight in her heart did mercy come,
chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
was used in giving gentle doom:
and taught it thus anew to greet:
'i hate' she altered with an end,
that followed it as gentle day,
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away.
'i hate', from hate away she threw,
and saved my life saying 'not you'.

poor soul the centre of my sinful earth,
my sinful earth these rebel powers array,
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
why so large cost having so short a lease,
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
then soul live thou upon thy servant's loss,
and let that pine to aggravate thy store;
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
