Where is my judgment fled,
that censures falsely what they see aright?
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
what means the world to say it is not so?
if it be not, then love doth well denote,
love's eye is not so true as all men's: no,
how can it? o how can love's eye be true,  
that is so vexed with watching and with tears?
no marvel then though i mistake my view,
the sun it self sees not, till heaven clears.
o cunning love, with tears thou keep'st me bling,
lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

canst thou o cruel, say i love thee not,
when i against my self with thee partake?
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of my self, all-tyrant, for thy sake?
who hateth thee that i do call my friend,
on whom frown'st thou that i do fawn upon,
nay if thou lour'st on me do i not spend
revenge upon my self with present moan?
what merit do i in my self respect,
that is so proud thy service to despise,
when all my best doth worship thy defect,
commanded by the motion of thine
