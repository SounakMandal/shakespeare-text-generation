Thee i am fortune's babe,
have not so love, yet love to tell me so,
as testy sick men when their deaths be near,
no news but health from their physicians know.
for if i should despair i should grow mad,
and in my madness might speak ill of thee,
now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be.
that i may not be so, nor thou belied,
bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go,
if thine eyes are blazing foll constancy addeth to hide,
by save i lost that being grown a themselves assured,
and peace proclaims olives of endless age.
yet what it be sound the scornower at am is prove,
the one, for thy straight in her heart did mercy come,
chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
was used in giving gentle doom:
and taught it thus anew to greet:
'i hate' she altered with an end,
that followed it as gentle day,
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away.
'i hate', from hate away she threw,
and saved my life saying 'not you'.

poor soul
